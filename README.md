## weather-data-fetcher
Weather Data Fetcher is a Python-based project that enables users to retrieve weather information for specific dates through a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI). The project consists of two primary components:  Flask API (app.py) and CLI Program (cli_program.py) 

Flask API (app.py): A straightforward Flask web application serving weather data in JSON format. The API provides endpoints to access temperature, wind speed, and pressure data for user-specified dates.

CLI Program (cli_program.py): The command-line tool allows users to interact with the Flask API seamlessly. Users can choose to fetch and display temperature, wind speed, or pressure data by providing a desired date.

This project showcases how to efficiently retrieve data from an external API using Python's requests library and present the data through a convenient CLI interface. The Weather Data Fetcher can be used as a foundation to build upon more advanced weather-related functionalities in various applications.

## Key features

Data Retrieval: The project demonstrates efficient data retrieval from an external API, leveraging Python's requests library.

Flask API: The Flask API follows a RESTful architecture, making it easy to integrate with various applications or services.

CLI Interface: The CLI program offers a user-friendly way to interact with the weather data, making it accessible to both developers and non-developers.

## Usage
